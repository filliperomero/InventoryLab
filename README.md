## About The Project

<strong>Inventory Lab</strong> is a project which contains a modular inventory system built as a plugin for Unreal Engine, designed to be easily reused and integrated across multiple projects.

The system provides a clean and scalable foundation for inventory-related features, supporting both Blueprint and C++ workflows. It includes essential functionality such as:

- Adding and removing items
- Configurable slots and item organization
- User Interface integration using UMG
- Easily extendable for features like chests, looting, banks, and more

By implementing this system as a plugin, the goal is to promote code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns, allowing developers to plug the inventory into any Unreal project with minimal setup.

Whether you're building a single-player RPG or a multiplayer survival game, this plugin serves as a solid starting point for your inventory logic.
